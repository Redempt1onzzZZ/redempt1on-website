# Intro

Hi! My Chinese name is Zhiyuan Li (ÊùéÂøóËøú), and my English name is Zane Lee. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences [(UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) and the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Science [(ISCAS)](http://www.iscas.ac.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Jingzheng Wu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~jingzheng) and Associate Prof. [Xiang Ling](https://ryderling.github.io/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from School of Artificial Intelligence at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2022.

My research interests include AI systems security and software engineering, etc. Besides, I am also exploring how to use insights from software to improve the robustness of hardware. My current work focuses on the security of deep learning libraries/compilers.

# Research Interests
- Security of AI Systems
    - Security of DL libraries/compilers, LLM safety (language models and multi-modal models)
- Fuzz Testing
    - Fuzzing for everything (software and hardware), Fuzzing with LLMs
